# WarmySender for AI agents

WarmySender is an outreach platform with five channels — cold email, email warmup, LinkedIn, Instagram and WhatsApp — plus real-time email verification and a 200M+ B2B lead database. This skill teaches an agent (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, and Hermes Agent, or any agent that speaks MCP) how to run it through the hosted WarmySender MCP server.

Your agent can run the entire outreach — build, launch and manage cold email, LinkedIn, Instagram and WhatsApp campaigns, verify emails, search and save leads, and tune warmup, all in plain language — while WarmySender's scheduler keeps every account inside safe limits no matter who's driving.

---

## 1. Connect first

<!-- GENERATED:connect START -->
WarmySender is a hosted MCP server (streamable HTTP) at:

```
https://warmysender.com/mcp
```

**Sign-in is the default.** The client registers itself and the user signs in to WarmySender in the browser — no key to paste. Use the API-key form only for clients that cannot sign in, or when the user prefers a key.

If your agent has no MCP settings at all, the user can paste this paragraph into the chat:

> Connect to WarmySender: it is an MCP server at https://warmysender.com/mcp that uses OAuth sign-in (no API key needed). Add it as a streamable-HTTP MCP server, open the sign-in link it returns so I can approve access, then install the WarmySender skill from https://github.com/fortuneflick/warmysender-claude-plugin (`npx skills add fortuneflick/warmysender-claude-plugin`). Never send a message yourself — WarmySender's scheduler paces every email, LinkedIn, Instagram and WhatsApp action inside safe limits.

### Per-client connect commands

#### Claude

Sign in (default):

```text
https://warmysender.com/mcp
```

In Claude open Customize → Connectors, choose + then Add custom connector, paste this address and click Add. Claude then opens a WarmySender sign-in — approve it and you are connected.

API-key fallback — `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warmysender": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@warmysender/mcp",
        "--api-key=ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Paste into your claude_desktop_config.json and restart Claude Desktop.

#### ChatGPT

Sign in (default):

```bash
codex mcp add warmysender --url https://warmysender.com/mcp
codex mcp login warmysender
```

ChatGPT Plus and every plan above it include Codex. Run both lines in your terminal; the second opens your browser to sign in to WarmySender.

API-key fallback:

```bash
export WARMYSENDER_API_KEY=ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
codex mcp add warmysender --url https://warmysender.com/mcp --bearer-token-env-var WARMYSENDER_API_KEY
```

ChatGPT Plus and every plan above it include Codex. Run both lines, adding the export to your shell profile so it sticks.

#### Claude Code

Sign in (default):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http warmysender https://warmysender.com/mcp
```

Run this once in your terminal, then type /mcp inside Claude Code (or run claude mcp login warmysender) and sign in to WarmySender in the browser.

API-key fallback:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http warmysender https://warmysender.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Run this once in your terminal.

#### Cursor

Sign in (default) — `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warmysender": {
      "url": "https://warmysender.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Use the Add to Cursor button, or paste this into .cursor/mcp.json in your project root and sign in when Cursor asks.

API-key fallback — `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warmysender": {
      "url": "https://warmysender.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the Add to Cursor button, or paste this into .cursor/mcp.json in your project root.

#### Codex

Sign in (default):

```bash
codex mcp add warmysender --url https://warmysender.com/mcp
codex mcp login warmysender
```

Run both lines in your terminal; the second opens your browser to sign in to WarmySender.

API-key fallback:

```bash
export WARMYSENDER_API_KEY=ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
codex mcp add warmysender --url https://warmysender.com/mcp --bearer-token-env-var WARMYSENDER_API_KEY
```

Run both lines, adding the export to your shell profile so it sticks.

#### OpenClaw

Sign in (default):

```bash
openclaw mcp add warmysender --url https://warmysender.com/mcp --transport streamable-http --auth oauth
openclaw mcp login warmysender
```

Run both lines; the second opens a WarmySender sign-in in your browser. OpenClaw ignores static headers while sign-in is on, so no key is ever stored.

API-key fallback:

```bash
openclaw mcp set warmysender '{"url":"https://warmysender.com/mcp","headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"}}'
```

Run this once to register WarmySender. OpenClaw can then call any of WarmySender's 78 tools.

#### Hermes Agent

Sign in (default) — `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  warmysender:
    url: "https://warmysender.com/mcp"
    auth: oauth
```

Add this to ~/.hermes/config.yaml, then run /reload-mcp in the chat and sign in when prompted.

API-key fallback — `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  warmysender:
    url: "https://warmysender.com/mcp"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Add this to ~/.hermes/config.yaml, then run /reload-mcp in the chat.

#### Muse Code

This client connects with an API key — `~/.config/muse/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "mcp_servers": {
    "warmysender": {
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "url": "https://warmysender.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save this as ~/.config/muse/settings.json (create the folder if it is not there yet) and start Muse Code again. Keep the schema_version line — Muse Code rejects the file without it. If you already have a settings file, add only the warmysender block inside your existing mcp_servers.

#### Grok Bot

This client connects with an API key:

```json
{
  "name": "warmysender",
  "url": "https://warmysender.com/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  }
}
```

Open grok.com/connectors → New Connector → Custom, paste the server address and use your key as the bearer token. Type @ in a chat to attach WarmySender.

#### Windsurf

Sign in (default) — `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warmysender": {
      "serverUrl": "https://warmysender.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Paste into ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json and sign in when Windsurf asks.

API-key fallback — `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "warmysender": {
      "serverUrl": "https://warmysender.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Paste into ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json.

#### Zed

This client connects with an API key — `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "warmysender": {
      "command": {
        "path": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "@warmysender/mcp",
          "--api-key=ws_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add to your Zed settings.json under context_servers.
<!-- GENERATED:connect END -->

### API-key fallback

Create a key in the WarmySender app under **Settings → API Keys** (keys start with `ws_`). Give the key only the scopes the job needs — a read-only key is enough for reporting. Never paste a key into a chat message, a log or a file you commit; put it in the client's config or an environment variable as shown above. Rotate it from the same Settings page at any time.

---

## 2. Hard rules for the agent (read first)

1. **Never send a message yourself.** There is no "send" tool. `create_*` writes a draft; `start_*`, `resume_*` and `enroll_*` only hand work to WarmySender's scheduler, which paces every email, LinkedIn, Instagram and WhatsApp action inside each account's safe daily, weekly and hourly limits and the gradual ramp for new accounts.
2. **Never claim to raise a limit.** No tool can raise a cap, skip the ramp, or bypass a check. If a campaign is slow, explain the pacing (`list_skipped_actions`, `get_linkedin_campaign_throttle`) — do not "retry harder".
3. **Connecting or disconnecting accounts stays in the app.** Mailboxes, LinkedIn seats, Instagram accounts and WhatsApp numbers are connected by the user at warmysender.com. If none is connected, say so and stop.
4. **Call `get_workspace_info` first.** It tells you which workspace you are in, which scopes you hold and what the plan allows. Do not guess.
5. **Read before you write.** Prefer `list_*` / `get_*` tools to establish state (existing campaigns, templates, mailboxes, allowance) before any write.
6. **Confirm with the user before `start_*`, `resume_*`, `enroll_*`, `pause_*`, `unenroll_*`, `delete_*`, `close_*`, `cancel_*` and `remove_*`.** Tools marked destructive in the catalogue below carry `destructiveHint` — show the user what will change and wait for a yes. Never pass `force: true` to a start tool on your own initiative; report the listed problems and only pass it if the user explicitly says "launch anyway".
7. **Every cold-email campaign needs a sending window and an opt-out sentence.** Set `sending_window_start` / `sending_window_end` / `schedule_days` / `timezone` on `create_campaign`, and make sure the workspace footer is configured (`update_workspace_settings`: postal address, opt-out style `link` or `reply`, opt-out wording). The footer is appended for you — do not hand-write a second unsubscribe line.
8. **Spending is visible before it happens.** Check `get_verification_allowance` before `submit_verification_batch`; `search_leads` is free, `save_leads` / `export_leads` use the monthly allowance or lead credits. Say how much will be used before you use it.
9. **Report facts, not guesses.** Quote the tool result (counts, statuses, reasons). If a tool returns an error, show the message to the user as-is and stop; do not loop.

## 3. Tool catalogue (78 tools)

All 78 tools are workspace-scoped: a tool only ever sees the workspace the signed-in user (or key) belongs to. "read-only" tools change nothing; "mutating" tools write drafts, settings or scheduler work; "destructive" tools stop, remove or cancel something and should be confirmed first.

### Cold email & prospects (19 tools)

### Email verification (7 tools)

Verify a single address or submit a whole list, check how much of your allowance is left before you spend it, follow results as they come in, stop a run and get the unused credits back, and turn the usable results into a ready-to-use list — reported as confirmed mailboxes plus ones on mail servers that accept every address, so your agent knows what it actually has. All on the same safe pacing and allowance as the in-app verifier, so an agent can’t burst it.

## 4. Workflows and example prompts

### Cold email campaign from a list

> "Create a 3-step cold email campaign called 'Q4 agencies' for the 'Agencies EU' list, send Mon–Fri 9–17 Europe/Berlin, 40 a day per mailbox, stop on reply. Use my 'Intro v2' template for step 1. Show me the draft before you start it."

1. `get_workspace_info` → `list_mailboxes` (pick warmed, healthy mailboxes) → `list_prospects` / list id → `list_email_templates` → `get_email_template`.
2. `create_campaign` with steps, `timezone`, `sending_window_start/end`, `schedule_days`, `max_sends_per_mailbox_per_day`, `stop_on_reply`, `mailbox_ids`.
3. Confirm the footer with `update_workspace_settings` if the user has not set an address / opt-out style.
4. `enroll_prospects` (list id) → show the summary → **ask** → `start_campaign`.
5. Later: `get_campaign` for stats; `list_skipped_actions` when the user asks why little went out.

### Warmup tune

> "Which mailboxes are still ramping? Set every Google mailbox that's past day 14 to 40 warmup emails a day with a 30% reply rate."

`list_mailboxes` → `get_warmup_stats` / `get_mailbox_health` → `bulk_update_warmup` (returns a job id) → `get_job_status`. Warmup keeps running on its own; you only tune it.

### LinkedIn campaign

> "Build a LinkedIn campaign: invite with a short note, wait for acceptance, then a 2-line message. Enroll the 'SaaS founders' list on my main account and start it."

`list_linkedin_accounts` → `get_linkedin_account_health` → `create_linkedin_campaign` (steps such as send_invite → wait_accept → send_message) → `enroll_in_linkedin_campaign` → **ask** → `start_linkedin_campaign`. If it looks slow: `get_linkedin_campaign_throttle` explains which allowance is binding and when it lifts.

### Instagram DM campaign

> "Start an Instagram DM campaign to the 'Fitness creators' list from @ourbrand with a two-message sequence, 24h apart."

`list_instagram_accounts` → `get_instagram_account_health` → `create_instagram_campaign` → `enroll_in_instagram_campaign` → **ask** → `start_instagram_campaign`. New accounts ramp up gradually; report the ramp stage rather than promising volume.

### WhatsApp campaign

> "Create a WhatsApp campaign for the 'Webinar sign-ups' list from the +44 number: one message today, a follow-up in 3 days if no reply."

`list_whatsapp_accounts` → `get_whatsapp_account_health` → `create_whatsapp_campaign` → `enroll_in_whatsapp_campaign` → **ask** → `start_whatsapp_campaign`. First messages to new contacts have their own daily budget; explain it if the user expects more.

### Verify a list

> "Verify the 'Trade show 2026' list and make me a clean list of the deliverable addresses."

`get_verification_allowance` → **tell the user the cost** → `submit_verification_batch` (`list_id`) → `get_verification_result` until finished → `create_list_from_verification`. Use `cancel_verification_batch` if the user changes their mind; unused credits come back.

### Search 200M+ leads and save

> "Find marketing directors at software companies in Texas, show me 25, then save the best 100 to a new list called 'TX marketing'."

`search_leads` (free, masked results) → present → **confirm the allowance/credit use** → `save_leads` with `new_list_name`, or `export_leads` for full rows. Then enroll the list in a campaign as above.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Sign-in loop / the agent keeps asking to sign in** — follow https://warmysender.com/documentation/connecting-an-ai-agent-that-asks-you-to-sign-in (finish the browser sign-in in the same profile the agent opened; remove and re-add the server if the token was revoked).
- **"insufficient scope"** — the key lacks a scope the tool needs. Create a new key with the right scopes under Settings → API Keys and reconnect; `get_workspace_info` lists the scopes a key holds.
- **"plan upgrade required" / a feature is not available** — the workspace's plan does not include that channel or agent throughput. Tell the user which feature is gated and point them to https://warmysender.com/pricing; do not retry.
- **Campaign started but nothing sent** — that is usually pacing. Read `list_skipped_actions` (email) or `get_linkedin_campaign_throttle` (LinkedIn) and report the reasons; do not pause/resume to "kick" it.
- **No mailbox / account connected** — connecting accounts is done in the app, not by the agent. Send the user to warmysender.com.
